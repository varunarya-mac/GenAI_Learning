In Natural Language Processing (NLP), converting text to vectors is a fundamental step for many machine learning models. 

Here are some common methods to achieve this:

**Bag of Words (BoW):**
Represents text as a collection of word frequencies.
Ignores grammar and word order.


**Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):**
Similar to BoW but also considers the importance of words in the entire corpus.
Reduces the weight of common words and increases the weight of rare words.


**Word Embeddings:**
Dense vector representations of words.
Capture semantic meaning and relationships between words.
Common models: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.


**Sentence Embeddings:**
Represent entire sentences as vectors.
Capture the meaning of sentences.
Common models: Universal Sentence Encoder, BERT, Sentence-BERT.
